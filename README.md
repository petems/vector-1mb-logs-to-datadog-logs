# vector-1mb-logs-to-datadog-logs

## What is this?

A sandbox/lab repo for seeing how Vector can reduce take a log with a size above 1MB, transform the data and reduce it's size and then send it to the Datadog logs API.

## Why?

A customer had a usecase where they wanted to send logs that contained a large complex XML dump that contained over 1MB of information.

Datadog logs have a 1MB limit, anything past that limit is truncated (See https://docs.datadoghq.com/logs/guide/log-collection-troubleshooting-guide/?tab=linux#truncated-logs)

Vector and it's enterprise implementation, Observability Pipelines, can be used to slice-and-dice the log into something Datadog would accept. 

## How?

In this demo, Vector is running a simple topology in which the `chunky_http_json` source fetches a JSON entry from the a local API instance that serves a log greater than 1MB (the body is an escaped XML string that's 1MB, taken from: https://examplefile.com/code/xml/1-mb-xml)

It then uses the `parse_xml` function to read the XML, and convert it to JSON, and it then sends those logs off to stdout via the `console` sink for debugging.

> WIP: Figure out a way of slicing the now JSON-ified log into smaller parts with VRL

To run this scenario, make sure you have the `DD_API_KEY` environment variable set to your Datadog
API key and then run:

```bash
$ docker compose up
```

You should then see the Vector container running, fetching a log from the DummyJSON API and then sending it to Datadog

```
$ docker compose up
